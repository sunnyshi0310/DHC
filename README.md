# DHC
Data-driven Hierarchical Control (DHC) Structure
DHC structure is designed to improve performance of robot systems operatering under the effect of system and/or environemnt uncertainty. The efficacy of it is demonstrated in simulation and experimentally using serial robots. The required code is listed in this repo.
